# uranium_surface_hydride_random_nulceation
A code used to simulate the random nucleation of hydride on the surface of uranium.

Pre-requisite packages:
MOOSE see: https://mooseframework.inl.gov/

For the example study on nucleation, MOOSE input files containing simulations of grain boundary nucleation, strain-induced nucleation, and random nucleation of polycrystals are provided. These files are available in the form of ".i" files. Additionally, ".m" files are also provided to visualize the influence of grain boundaries and strains on the total free energy of the system.
